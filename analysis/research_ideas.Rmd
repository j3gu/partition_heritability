1. Using gene expression levels as phenotypes, we will perform S-LDSC regression separately for cis-eQTLs and trans-eQTLs.
2. The window size in cis regions is defined as SNPs that are located 1MB away from TSS and for trans as SNPs in different chromosomes. 
3. 


* Future Directions
1. The issue of mappability may not be considered for the trans eQTL analysis done by the eQTL consortium. We may check if there are spurious signals for trans-eQTLs and if yes we need to correct them before downstream analysis.

Issue of mappability:
