* Analysis methods
1. In our analysis, we have gene expression levels as phenotypes. We should perform S-LDSC for each gene against SNPs that are stratefied into different functional categories.
2. In your paper, you estimated the enrichment of each functional category, defined as the proportion
of heritability in that category divided by the proportion of SNPs in that category.
